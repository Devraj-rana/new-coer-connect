# Comment Delete Functionality

## ✅ **Users Can Now Delete Their Own Comments!**

### 🔧 **How It Works:**

1. **Comment Ownership**: Users can delete their own comments
2. **Admin Override**: Admins (configured in `lib/admin.ts`) can delete any comment
3. **Visual Indicator**: Small trash icon appears next to the timestamp for deletable comments
4. **Confirmation**: Users get a confirmation dialog before deletion
5. **Database Cleanup**: Comment is removed from both Comment collection and Post references

### 🎯 **Who Can Delete Comments:**

- ✅ **Comment Author**: Can delete their own comments
- ✅ **Admins**: Can delete any comment (for moderation)
- ❌ **Other Users**: Cannot delete comments they didn't write

### 🚀 **User Experience:**

1. **Comment Display**: Comments show with user info, timestamp, and content
2. **Delete Button**: Small trash icon appears for comments you can delete
3. **Confirmation**: "Are you sure you want to delete this comment?" dialog
4. **Feedback**: Success/error toast notifications
5. **Auto-refresh**: Page updates automatically after deletion

### 🛡️ **Security Features:**

- **Server-side Validation**: Database checks ownership/admin status
- **User Authentication**: Must be logged in to delete
- **Admin Check**: Uses the same admin system as post deletion
- **Database Integrity**: Removes comment from both collections properly

### 🎨 **Visual Design:**

- **Delete Button**: Small gray trash icon that turns red on hover
- **Positioning**: Located next to the comment timestamp
- **Size**: Compact (3x3) to not interfere with comment readability
- **Responsive**: Works on both desktop and mobile

### 📋 **Technical Implementation:**

- **Server Action**: `deleteCommentAction(commentId, postId)`
- **Client Component**: Updated `Comment.tsx` with delete functionality
- **Database Operations**: Removes from Comment collection and Post.comments array
- **Real-time Updates**: Uses `revalidatePath("/")` for immediate UI refresh

### 🔄 **Database Changes:**

1. **Delete Comment Document**: Removes from Comment collection
2. **Update Post Document**: Removes comment ID from post.comments array
3. **Atomic Operation**: Both operations succeed or fail together

Users can now manage their own comments while admins can moderate inappropriate content!
